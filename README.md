## Bitcoin Setup

#### Automatic with esplora plugin

This is the default behaviour.

Lamp is using [the C Esplora plugin for C-lightning](https://github.com/lvaccaro/esplora_clnd_plugin) as the Bitcoin backend of the lightning node (to fetch chain/blocks/transactions informations and send transactions).

You can point it to your own [Esplora](github.com/Blockstream/esplora) instance in the settings, and it uses [blockstream.info](https://blockstream.info) by default.


#### Manually with bitcoind rpc node
On Lamp settings, disable Esplora plugin and set the current Bitcoin RPC options:

- Bitcoin RPC username
- Bitcoin RPC password
- Bitcoin RPC host (default 127.0.0.1)
- Bitcoin RPC port (default 18332 for testnet)

## Tor Setup

#### Automatic with internal tor service

Lamp is using tor hidden service as default. A new hidden service will be created at the first running time.

#### Manually with Orbot

Open [Orbot](https://github.com/guardianproject/Orbot) and setup a fixed tor address by menu: Onion Services -> Hosted Services -> set a service name and port 9735. Restarting tor to discover and copy the local address.

On Lamp settings, enable proxy using orbot localhost gateway:

- proxy: 127.0.0.1:9050
- announce address: tor_address
- bind address: 127.0.0.1:9735

Read the following instructions at [Tor on clightning](https://lightning.readthedocs.io/TOR.html) to setup address on different network scenario.
